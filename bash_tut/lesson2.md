## bash comments

comments are important for remembering this question's answer: **"what did I do?"**

if you want to write a single line comment just use `#` 

__example__: &nbsp;&nbsp; `# hello, i am a single line comment`

if you want to write multi line comments you can use these ways 

```bash
<<comments 
    my magic comments
comments
```

**or**

```bash
: ' 
hello i am comment
hey! me too.
me too!
'
```
